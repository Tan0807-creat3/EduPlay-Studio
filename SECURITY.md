## EduPlay Studio Security Policy

This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities related to **EduPlay Studio** (the application and its source code).

### Scope

- Source code in the repository: `https://github.com/Tan0807-creat3/EduPlay-Studio`

- Installers, distributable packages, and binaries built from this repository
- Any backend services or APIs used by EduPlay Studio (now or in the future)

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** publicly disclose security vulnerabilities before contacting the project maintainer.

You can report a vulnerability using one of the following channels:

1. Create a GitHub issue:
   - Open a new issue in the repository and, if possible, add a `security` label.
   - Provide a short description including:
     - Environment (operating system, Python version, EduPlay Studio version)
     - Clear reproduction steps
     - Screenshots or logs (only if they do not contain sensitive data)

2. Send a direct email:
   - Email: `eduplay.line@hotmail.com` - `tannguyenthanh498@gmail.com`- `eduplay.pro@hotmail.com` - `tanntfx37798@funix.edu.vn`
   - Use a subject line starting with `[SECURITY]` so the report can be prioritized.

### Information to Include

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact (for example: data exposure, code execution, crash)
- Detailed, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- EduPlay Studio version, operating system, and any relevant configuration
- Any ideas or suggestions for mitigation or a possible fix (optional but very helpful)

### Response and Resolution

After receiving a valid report:

- The maintainer will aim to respond within **7–14 business days**
- If the vulnerability is confirmed:
  - A fix will be planned, implemented, and released
  - Your contribution may be acknowledged in the CHANGELOG or credits, unless you prefer to remain anonymous

There is currently **no formal bug bounty program**, but all high‑quality security reports are greatly appreciated.

### Public Disclosure

After a fix has been released and users have had reasonable time to upgrade:

- You are welcome to publish a blog post or technical write‑up
- If possible, please notify the maintainer before publication so that official documentation can be updated consistently
