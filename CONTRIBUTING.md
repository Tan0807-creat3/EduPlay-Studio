## Contribution Workflow

All contributions should:

- Be linked to an issue (existing or newly created)
- Be educational in nature
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies

Steps to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `dev`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit using Conventional Commits
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear explanation

## Branch Naming Convention

We use clear and predictable branch names.

### Long-lived Branches

- **main**  
  Production-ready, stable branch

- **dev**  
  Main development branch

- **test**  
  Used for testing before merging into main

---

### Temporary Branches

- **feature/** — new features  
  Example: `feature/interactive-quiz`

- **bugfix/** — non-critical bug fixes  
  Example: `bugfix/score-calculation`

- **hotfix/** — urgent fixes

- **docs/** — documentation-only changes  
  Example: `docs/setup-guide`

- **experimental/** — testing new ideas

- **wip/** — work in progress

- **merging/** — temporary conflict resolution

---

### Branch Naming Rules

- Use `/` or `-` as separators  
- Start with a category (`feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, etc.)
- Avoid numeric-only names  
- Keep names short and descriptive
- Be consistent

---

## Commit Message Convention

We follow **Conventional Commits**:  
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

Common commit types:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting only
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `perf:` performance improvements
- `test:` adding or fixing tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks
- `ci:` CI/CD related changes
- `build:` build system or dependencies

Rules:

- Commit messages must be **lowercase**
- Breaking changes must use `!` or include  
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer

Examples:

- `feat(game): add interactive quiz mode`
- `fix(ui): prevent button overlap on small screens`

---

## Coding Style Guidelines

Code should prioritize:

- Readability
- Simplicity
- Educational clarity

General principles:

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid deeply nested logic
- Comment non-obvious behavior
- Prefer explicit logic over clever shortcuts
- Keep functions and files reasonably small

Follow the existing style of the module you are working on.

Remember:  
This repository is not only software — it is also a **learning resource**.
