# Contributing to EduPlay-Studio

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to EduPlay-Studio.

We truly appreciate all forms of contribution — whether it is source code, documentation, design, testing, or constructive feedback. Every contribution matters and helps the project move forward. However, to avoid any misunderstanding, please note the following:

 - Branches submitted by contributors will not be merged directly. Instead, they are treated as idea proposals, which the core team may review, adapt, and refine into an official version aligned with the project’s overall direction.

 - Your name will not appear in the Contributors list, but your effort will always be acknowledged in the contribution notes of the next release and in the acknowledgements section.
EduPlay-Studio is a non-profit, open-source educational project.

Our goal is not speed or flashiness, but clarity, educational value, and long-term sustainability.
All contributions should respect and support this spirit.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute **with or without writing code**.

### As a Community Member

You can help by:

- Answering questions or joining discussions in Issues
- Confirming bugs by testing them locally
- Asking clarifying questions on unclear issues
- Suggesting better wording, naming, or user flows
- Giving feedback from a learner’s or teacher’s perspective

Clear communication is as valuable as clean code.

### As a Developer

If you want to contribute code, start small and focused.

We recommend looking at issues by label:

- **Good first issue**  
  Beginner-friendly tasks  
  —› [View issues](https://github.com/Tan0807-creat3/EduPlay-Studio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

- **Help wanted**  
  Tasks where assistance is needed  
  —› [View issues](https://github.com/Tan0807-creat3/EduPlay-Studio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

- **Bug**  
  Fixing bugs with immediate impact  
  —› [View issues](https://github.com/Tan0807-creat3/EduPlay-Studio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)

- **Enhancement**

## Contribution Workflow

All contributions should:

- Be linked to an issue (existing or newly created)
- Be educational in nature
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies

Steps to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `dev`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit using Conventional Commits
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear explanation

## Branch Naming Convention

We use clear and predictable branch names.

### Long-lived Branches

- **main**  
  Production-ready, stable branch

- **dev**  
  Main development branch

- **test**  
  Used for testing before merging into main

---

### Temporary Branches

- **feature/** — new features  
  Example: `feature/interactive-quiz`

- **bugfix/** — non-critical bug fixes  
  Example: `bugfix/score-calculation`

- **hotfix/** — urgent fixes

- **docs/** — documentation-only changes  
  Example: `docs/setup-guide`

- **experimental/** — testing new ideas

- **wip/** — work in progress

- **merging/** — temporary conflict resolution

---

### Branch Naming Rules

- Use `/` or `-` as separators  
- Start with a category (`feature`, `bugfix`, `docs`, etc.)
- Avoid numeric-only names  
- Keep names short and descriptive
- Be consistent

---

## Commit Message Convention

We follow **Conventional Commits**:  
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

Common commit types:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation
- `style:` formatting only
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `perf:` performance improvements
- `test:` adding or fixing tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks
- `ci:` CI/CD related changes
- `build:` build system or dependencies

Rules:

- Commit messages must be **lowercase**
- Breaking changes must use `!` or include  
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer

Examples:

- `feat(game): add interactive quiz mode`
- `fix(ui): prevent button overlap on small screens`

---

## Coding Style Guidelines

Code should prioritize:

- Readability
- Simplicity
- Educational clarity

General principles:

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid deeply nested logic
- Comment non-obvious behavior
- Prefer explicit logic over clever shortcuts
- Keep functions and files reasonably small

Follow the existing style of the module you are working on.

Remember:  
This repository is not only software — it is also a **learning resource**.
